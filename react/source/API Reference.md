### Suspense
Suspense lets components 'wait' for something before rendering. Today, Suspense only supports one use case: `loading components dynamically with React.lazy`. 

`Object.freeze()`: freezes an object, A frozen object can no longer be changed; freezing an object prevents new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed. In addition, freezing an object also prevents its prototype from being changed.
> `Object.isFrozen()`
`Object.seal()`:  the sealed object can have their existing properties changed. the freezed object's properties are made immutable.
